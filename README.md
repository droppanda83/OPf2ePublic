# PF2e Pathfinder Grid Encounter

This is a lightweight, static web app for running a Pathfinder 2e encounter on a 2D grid. It provides:

- A configurable square grid with walls, start/end placement, and A* pathfinding.
- A Pathbuilder 2e JSON upload panel that displays character summaries for quick reference.

## Usage

Open `index.html` in your browser. Use the controls to place walls, set start/end points, and run the pathfinder.

To load characters, export a Pathbuilder 2e JSON file and upload it using the file picker. Characters will appear on the left panel.
